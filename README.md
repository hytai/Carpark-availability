# Welcome to the carpark-availability app!
This was created as a side project to explore the use of React.js, APIs, and CSS.
Please note the code will not work as-is as the API key is defunct.

## What this app does
Retrieves carpark information and lot availability from [Data.gov.sg](https://data.gov.sg/developer) via API call and displays the information on a map. Features an expandable pop-up box for additional details on the carpark type.
